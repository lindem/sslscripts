# LEGAL NOTICE and LICENSE TERMS

All of this was written in 2014 by Timo Lindemann for my employer, who, let's
be honest, probably doesn't even use it, because 4096 bits and no key
passphrase encryption is too insecure, and there are a bazillion settings to
openssl which do not even concern me as long as the stuff I am doing works.

These scripts are therefore placed into the public domain, as everyone can do
this. Do whatever you want with these, but leave me alone about them.
